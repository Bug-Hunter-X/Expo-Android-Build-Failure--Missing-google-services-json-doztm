The solution is to obtain the `google-services.json` file from the Firebase console and place it in the correct directory within your Expo project's Android directory.  The file should be located at `android/app/google-services.json`. 

1. **Navigate to your Firebase project:** In the Firebase console, select your project.
2. **Get the config file:** Go to the project settings and find the `google-services.json` file for Android. Download it.
3. **Place the file:**  Copy the downloaded `google-services.json` file to the `android/app` directory of your Expo project.
4. **Rebuild the project:** Run `expo build:android` again. The build should now succeed.
