This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the following error message:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong: 
Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices'.
> File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it.

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. 
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.

* Get more help at https://help.gradle.org
```
This error typically happens because the `google-services.json` file, which contains the configuration for Firebase or other Google services, is missing from the project's Android directory.
